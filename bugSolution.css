To solve this, ensure that all units are consistent within the `calc()` function.  Correct syntax is also crucial. For example, to calculate a width that is 10 pixels less than 100% of its container, use `width: calc(100% - 10px);`.  If nesting `calc()` expressions, carefully check the parentheses to avoid unexpected operator precedence.  Using spaces around operators can improve readability and reduce the chances of errors.  Always verify browser compatibility as support for `calc()` might vary across older browsers.
