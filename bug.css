The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS, but sometimes the calculations may not be performed as expected if the units are not consistent or if there are syntax errors. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will not, because the unit `px` is missing from the second term. Another common issue is incorrect use of parentheses when nesting `calc()` functions.
